## EXISTING LAKU LAYOUT TO PRESERVE

**Your Current Mobile App Has:**
- A header at the top with search bar that says "Cari di LAKU..." and a camera icon
- A bottom navigation bar with 5 icons: Beranda (home), Video, Pesan (messages), Keranjang (shopping cart with badge), and Profil (profile)
- A 2-column product grid on the homepage
- Product cards with images, names, red prices (Rp format), gray struck-through original prices, and "X+ terjual" (sold count)
- Clean white background with minimal design

**The product page should work within this existing layout, not replace it.**

---

## PAGE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

### At The Very Top
The page starts right below your existing header. Add a small back arrow button to the left side of the existing header when on a product page. Keep everything else about the header the same.

### Image Section (First Thing User Sees)
When you first land on the page, you see a large full-width image carousel that takes up most of the screen above the fold. This carousel shows the product from different angles. 

**Image Carousel Details:**
- The images are swipeable - you can swipe left or right with your finger to see different product photos
- There's a small counter in the bottom-right or top-right corner showing which image you're on, like "1/5" or "3/6"
- The images snap into place when you swipe - they don't just scroll freely
- When you tap on an image, it could open a fullscreen view where you can zoom in
- Small dot indicators at the bottom showing which image is active (optional)

**Taobao does this:** They have a full-width image with small thumbnail previews at the bottom showing all available images. The counter shows clearly "1/5" in white text over the image.

**Shopee does this:** Similar carousel with smooth swipe gestures and a counter badge.

### Price and Basic Info Section
Right below the images, there's a white section with padding showing:

**Badge Row:**
At the very top of this section, small colorful badges like "Trends" in purple, "Choice" in black, or other promotional badges. These are small pill-shaped badges that sit in a row.

**Product Title:**
Below the badges is the product name in large, bold text. This is prominent and easy to read. The title might be 2-3 lines long.

**Price Display:**
The most important visual element here - shown very prominently:
- Current price in large, bold RED text (your Laku red color)
- Original price next to it in smaller, GRAY text with a strikethrough line
- A small badge showing the discount percentage like "-25%" in red or orange background

The price difference should be immediately obvious - the red current price should be the most eye-catching element.

**Rating and Reviews:**
Below the price, show:
- Star rating (5 gold stars, filled based on rating)
- The numeric rating like "4.8"
- Review count in parentheses like "(1,247 reviews)"
- All in one horizontal line

**Verification/Trust Badge:**
If the purchase is verified or the seller is verified, show a small checkmark icon with "Verified Purchase" text in green.

### Tabs Section (Sticky Navigation)
This is a crucial organizational element. There are three tabs that allow you to switch between different types of information:

**Tab Bar Design:**
- Three equal-width tabs: "Goods" | "Details" | "Recommend"
- These tabs stick to the top of the screen as you scroll (but below your app's header)
- The active tab has a red underline or red text
- Inactive tabs are gray
- When you tap a tab, the content below changes

**Shopee Reference:** They have tabs exactly like this - you tap to switch between product details, shop information, and recommendations.

**Taobao Reference:** Similar tab system that organizes all the product information into digestible sections.
