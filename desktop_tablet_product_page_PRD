## EXISTING LAKU LAYOUT TO PRESERVE

**Your Current Desktop App Has:**
- A fixed left sidebar with the LAKU logo at the top
- Navigation items below the logo: Beranda, Video, Pesan, Keranjang, Profil, Lainnya
- The sidebar is about 15% of the screen width
- A search bar at the top of the main content area
- The main content area to the right of the sidebar showing a 3-4 column product grid
- Product cards with red prices, gray struck-through original prices, and "X+ terjual" format

**The product page should work WITHIN this existing layout, not replace it.**

---

## OVERALL LAYOUT CONCEPT

**SHEIN does this perfectly:**

When you visit a SHEIN product page, you see:
- Their navigation sidebar on the left (like your Laku sidebar - this stays)
- The main content area takes up the rest of the screen
- Within that main content area, the product page uses a two-column layout:
  - Left column (60% width): Product images
  - Right column (40% width): Product information that sticks as you scroll

**This is the pattern to follow - a layout WITHIN your main content area.**

---

## MAIN CONTENT AREA STRUCTURE

The product page renders in the space to the right of your existing Laku sidebar.

### At the Top (Header Area)
In the area where your search bar currently is, add:
- Breadcrumb navigation: "Home > Category > Product Name"
- Keep the search bar
- Add a share button or icon
- Keep your existing header structure

### Two-Column Layout (Main Content)

**LEFT COLUMN (60% of content area):**

**Vertical Thumbnail Strip:**
On the far left side of this column is a narrow vertical strip showing small thumbnail images of all product photos. Each thumbnail is:
- About 80-100 pixels square
- Stacked vertically with small gaps between them
- Has a border - the active thumbnail has a red or bold border
- Shows 5-6 thumbnails visible at once
- Can scroll if there are more than 6 images
- When you click a thumbnail, the main image changes

**SHEIN shows this:** Vertical thumbnails on the left, main image on the right.

**Main Product Image:**
To the right of the thumbnail strip is the large main product image:
- Square or slightly portrait aspect ratio
- High quality, detailed product photo
- When you hover over it with your mouse, it zooms in slightly or shows a zoom cursor
- Clicking it opens a fullscreen lightbox gallery
- Smooth transition when switching between images
- Shows which image you're viewing like "1/5" in a corner badge

**RIGHT COLUMN (40% of content area):**

This column contains all the product information and should "stick" as you scroll - meaning as you scroll down the page, this column stays visible until you reach the reviews section.

**Sticky Behavior:**
- When the page first loads, the right column is at the top
- As you scroll down, this column sticks to the top of the viewport
- It stops sticking when you scroll far enough to reach the reviews section
- This allows you to see product info while scrolling through images or description

## STICKY BEHAVIOR DETAILS

**Right Sidebar Stickiness:**

**SHEIN does this:**
- The right column starts at the top of the page
- As you scroll down, it "sticks" and moves with the viewport
- It continues to stick until the bottom of the product information
- When you reach the reviews section, it stops sticking
- The reviews section then has its own two-column layout

**This allows:**
- Product info always visible while viewing images
- Easy access to Add to Cart while browsing
- Efficient use of screen space
- Natural reading flow
