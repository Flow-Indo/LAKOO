# Overview
THERE ARE 4 OF YOU WORKING TOGETHER.
CROSS-AGENT RULES:

Scope Boundaries:
- Work exclusively within your assigned route directory
- Do not modify shared layouts (AppLayout, LeftSidebar, RightSidebar, BottomNav)
- Do not create duplicate stores or contexts

Shared Dependencies:
- Zustand stores: useCartStore, useAuthStore (import, don't recreate)
- Language system: useLanguage() from LanguageContext (import, don't recreate)
- UI components: Use shadcn/ui from @/components/ui
- Icons: Lucide React (consistent across all agents)

Design Consistency:
- Primary color: #dc2626 (LAKU red)
- Background: #F9FAFB (light gray)
- Cards: #FFFFFF with shadow-sm
- Typography: Compact sizing (text-xs, text-sm predominantly)
- Spacing: Tight padding and margins for high density

Translation Requirements:
- Every user-facing string must use t('translation.key')
- Add your translation keys to LanguageContext
- Provide both Indonesian and English versions

Responsive Requirements:
- Mobile-first approach
- Test at 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Account for safe areas on iOS
- Bottom navigation bar is 80px on mobile

Code Quality:
- Component files under 200 lines each
- Extract complex logic to utility functions
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for async operations

Testing Checklist:
- Component renders without errors
- Navigation works correctly
- State updates are reflected
- Responsive breakpoints work
- Translations load correctly
- No console errors

Build independently. Test in isolation. Your route should function as a complete feature without dependencies on other agents' work.


# UI & Styling Rules
- Always use the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes. 
- Do NOT install or import 'classnames' or 'clsx' directly.
- Every user-facing string must be wrapped in the `t()` function from `@/contexts/LanguageContext`. Do not use hardcoded English or Indonesian strings in components.

# Next.js Specific Rules
- Never use an <a> tag inside a <Link> component. Next.js 13+ handles the anchor tag automatically.
- All styling classes should be placed directly on the <Link> component.
